1). If you are collaborating with a classmate what is the first thing that each of the team members needs to do? Why is it important to do this step. Hint: After this step each team member would have diverged from the main branch?

The first thing they would need to do is to make a branch for themselves to work in. Its important to do this step because of this step each class mate can work without their work influencing the main repo

2). Why do developers use branchs?

Developers use branches when they want to add or experiment with work without it affecting main.

3).What is git? What is github? How does git and github work together?

git is a distributed version control system that is used to make code while github is used to save, edit , and control projects made using git.

4). Whats wrong with the following command sequences? What should be the correct command sequence? 
 

```
git commit -m "saving work"
git add .
git push
```
You should have used git add . first then write a commit message then pull. The correct sequence should be 

```
git add .
git commit -m "saving work"
git push
```
